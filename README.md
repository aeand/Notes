# Notes App

This is my minimalistic notes taking app for Android devices. 
It will create notes, txt files, in a folder called Notes in root. 

Start a note with "# creative" to add the tag creative to it. I use these tags to sort my notes.

There's also an autosave feature in case I forget to hit save.
